# Todoist-GoogleHome
A couple of some common custom ToDoist applications to work with Google Home

For now all I have up is the Python applications themselves which works with the ToDoist API. Soon it should integrate
with webhooks, IFTT, and with that connect to Google Home so I can control ToDoist with a Google Home.

ToDoist has its own integration with Google Home but it's somewhat limiting and requires telling the Google Home to talk
to ToDoist first. For instance you can't chain together the name, due date, and project in one command, it requires 3 individual
commands.
